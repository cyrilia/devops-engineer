# MARKDOWN

This is an easy way to write text or content for the web, and can easily be converted to HTML format

## FORMATING AND KEY CONCEPTS

### **HEADINGS**
    Headings are emphasised with the pound symbol (#) and there exists 3 level headings as follows:
        # HEADING - Level 1
        ## HEADING - Level 2
        ### HEADING - Level 3

### **BOLD**
Words are bolded with the double asterix or double underscore (** OR __)
        **This text is bold**
        __This is also bold__

### **ITALICS**
Words are made in italics using single asterix or single underscore (* OR _)
        *This text is in italicized*
        _This is also italicized_
    
   **Note:** In Markdown, there is no way to underline text because on the web underline content format are specifically recognized as links.

### **LISTS**
1. *Ordered Lists:* One can create a numbered list in order as seen below.
    1. List item 1
    2. List item 2
    3. List item 3

2. *Unordered Lists:* They can be created using an asterics or hyphen as below:
    * List 1
    * Another 
    * Unrelated item

### **BLOCKQUOTES**
Blockquotes are HTML elements that indicate that the enclosed text is an extended quotation
They can be created using the right angle bracket (>) as displayed below:
    > This is a block quote.

    > This content is
    > a multi-line
    > blockquote

### **LINKS**
They consist of both square brackets ([]) and parentheses (()). The structure is as follows:
    [Link Text](URL)
Reference style links: this can be effective when dealing with long URLs to avoid messing with the flow of information especially when working with plain text
    [Link Text][ref1]
    We can add some text in between as an example...

    [ref1]: <URL>

### **IMAGES**
The image's format is pretty similar to the Linking format to the exception that an exclamation mark (!) is added infront of the structure, see below.
    ![Alt Text](URL)
    **Note:**
        - The same approach with reference links applies here too.
        - Alt text refers to the message displayed when hovering over an image on the web.

## **BENEFITS OF NOTE TAKING**
1. Easy capture of information
2. Easy readable formatting in a Plain-text format
4. Easy HTML conversion
5. Easy sharing and syncing
6. Simple Learning curve: very simple to learn.
